# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: 
Take two lists containing the points as the elemen
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance with two decimal places
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
  
```#Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```

### OUTPUT:
![distance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115707860/227723548-af47207f-9e6f-4cdc-9586-3bd0d5f3cac9.png)


### RESULT:
Thus the program to distance between two points is executed successfully.
